A classic programming exercise that utilizes branching and looping. Here's how it works:
 • A user enters a number and the application returns all numbers from 1 to the user input with the following changes:
 ◦ All numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by "ping".
 ◦ All numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by "pong"
 ◦ All numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced by "ping-pong".

If the user enters 15, the program will return:
1
2
"ping"
4
"pong"
"ping"
7
8
"ping"
"pong"
11
